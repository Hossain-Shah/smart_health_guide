For pharmacy students in the United States and other English-speaking\r\ncountries, the growing Japanese-speaking population—whether due to tourism, academic\r\nexchange, or immigration—has introduced both challenges and opportunities. The accurate and\r\nculturally sensitive translation of medical and prescription information between English and\r\nJapanese is critical for safe and effective patient care. This paper provides an in-depth guide,\r\ndesigned for 2004 pharmacy curricula, to equip future pharmacists with the linguistic tools,\r\ntranslation strategies, cultural insights, and legal awareness necessary for English-Japanese and\r\nJapanese-English communication in medical contexts.\r\n\r\nThe discussion includes:\r\n\r\n   1. Linguistic structures and vocabulary contrasts between English and Japanese medical\r\n      terminology.\r\n   2. Common pitfalls in literal translation and strategies for producing clear, safe, and patient-\r\n      friendly equivalents.\r\n   3. Prescription label translation and dosage instructions—layout, units, and abbreviation\r\n      issues.\r\n   4. Cultural nuances that influence comprehension, adherence, and trust in pharmacist-\r\n      patient interactions.\r\n   5. Resources—both printed and digital (as available in 2004)—to support ongoing\r\n      translation accuracy and fluency development.\r\n   6. Case studies illustrating translation errors and their clinical consequences, with corrective\r\n      strategies.\r\n   7. Ethical and legal considerations for bilingual medical communication in the pharmacy\r\n      setting.\r\n\r\nThis paper integrates pharmacy practice, applied linguistics, intercultural communication, and\r\nprofessional ethics to offer a comprehensive resource for pharmacy students preparing to serve\r\nJapanese-speaking patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                                    1\r\n\f1. Introduction\r\n1.1 Purpose of the Paper\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this guide is to provide pharmacy students with the knowledge and practical\r\nskills to accurately and effectively translate medical and prescription information between\r\nEnglish and Japanese. In doing so, it aims to promote patient safety, improve medication\r\nadherence, and foster trust between pharmacists and Japanese-speaking patients.\r\n\r\nThe paper is designed not merely as a vocabulary list but as an applied, context-rich training\r\nresource. Students will learn how to navigate the unique structural, lexical, and cultural\r\nchallenges of English-Japanese translation, and how to integrate those skills into everyday\r\npharmacy practice.\r\n\r\n1.2 Relevance to 2004 Pharmacy Practice\r\n\r\nBy 2004, demographic shifts, educational exchanges, and global mobility had already begun to\r\ndiversify patient populations in many regions. While Japanese speakers in the U.S. represent a\r\nsmaller proportion compared to Spanish-speaking patients, their numbers are significant in\r\ncertain metropolitan areas, academic hubs, and tourist destinations. Furthermore, in Japan,\r\nEnglish-speaking expatriates and travelers rely on Japanese pharmacists for safe medication use.\r\n\r\nThus, pharmacy graduates who can bridge the English-Japanese language gap are better\r\npositioned for:\r\n\r\n   •   Employment in diverse U.S. communities.\r\n   •   International pharmacy roles, including in Japan.\r\n   •   Military and humanitarian missions involving Japanese speakers.\r\n   •   Academic and research collaborations.\r\n\r\n1.3 Scope and Limitations\r\n\r\nThis guide focuses on essential terminology, translation techniques, and cultural factors relevant\r\nto pharmacy and patient counseling. While it covers basic linguistic structures, it does not\r\nattempt to teach Japanese grammar comprehensively; rather, it emphasizes what pharmacy\r\nstudents need to know to function safely and effectively in professional contexts. The examples\r\nand resources reflect technology and print materials available as of 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                                 2\r\n\f2. The Linguistic Landscape\r\n2.1 Overview of Japanese Language Structure\r\n\r\nJapanese is an agglutinative language with subject-object-verb (SOV) word order, three writing\r\nsystems, and a highly developed system of politeness levels. For pharmacy students,\r\nunderstanding these structural elements is key to producing accurate translations.\r\n\r\nKey structural features:\r\n\r\n   •   Word order: \"Patient medicine take\" instead of \"Patient takes medicine.\"\r\n   •   Particles: Small words that mark grammatical function, such as o (object marker) or ni\r\n       (direction marker).\r\n   •   Verb endings: Indicate tense, politeness, and mood.\r\n   •   Honorifics: Speech forms that convey respect toward the patient.\r\n\r\n2.2 Differences Between English and Japanese in Medical Communication\r\n\r\nMedical English relies heavily on Greco-Latin roots, technical precision, and standardized\r\nabbreviations. Japanese medical terms may be:\r\n\r\n   •   Loanwords from English, often adapted into katakana (antibiotic → アンチバイオティ\r\n       ック, anchibaiotikku).\r\n   •   Native Japanese words describing symptoms in everyday language.\r\n   •   Sino-Japanese compounds using kanji (e.g., 高血圧 for hypertension).\r\n\r\nThese differences can lead to misunderstandings if one assumes a direct one-to-one equivalence.\r\n\r\n2.3 Commonly Used Scripts\r\n\r\nJapanese uses:\r\n\r\n   •   Kanji: Logographic characters from Chinese, often for core medical conditions (糖尿病\r\n       – diabetes).\r\n   •   Hiragana: Phonetic syllabary for grammatical elements and native words.\r\n   •   Katakana: Phonetic syllabary for loanwords and emphasis.\r\n   •   Romaji: Latin alphabet representation, used sparingly in Japan, more in bilingual labels.\r\n\r\nPharmacy students must recognize all three scripts to interpret and produce accurate labels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                                   3\r\n\f3. Core Medical Vocabulary\r\nFor pharmacy students aiming to work effectively in English–Japanese and Japanese–English\r\ntranslation of medical and prescription information, mastery of core vocabulary is essential. This\r\nvocabulary spans prescription instructions, symptom descriptions, body part names, dosage\r\nforms, and procedural terminology.\r\n\r\nThe lists and explanations below are arranged in English → Japanese\r\n(Kanji/Katakana/Hiragana) → Hepburn Romanization → Explanation/Usage Notes. In\r\n2004, printed bilingual glossaries were a mainstay, so the formatting here reflects the style of\r\ncomprehensive reference works common in that era.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1 Essential Prescription Terminology\r\n\r\n     English         Japanese Romanization                         Notes for Use\r\n                                                  Used for the formal written prescription\r\nPrescription        処方箋           Shohōsen\r\n                                                  document.\r\nMedication /                                      General term for medicine; context will clarify\r\n                    薬             Kusuri\r\nMedicine                                          prescription vs. OTC.\r\nTablet              錠剤            Jōzai           Generic term for pill/tablet form.\r\nCapsule             カプセル          Kapuseru        Loanword from English; written in katakana.\r\n                                                  General term; specific type may be indicated\r\nLiquid medicine     液剤            Ekizai\r\n                                                  before it.\r\nDosage              用量            Yōryō           Quantity per administration.\r\nFrequency           投与間隔          Tōyo kankaku Interval between doses.\r\n                    必要に応じ Hitsuyō ni\r\nAs needed                                         Often used for PRN instructions.\r\n                    て     ōjite\r\n                                                  Literally “before eating”; common in\r\nBefore meals        食前            Shokuzen\r\n                                                  directions.\r\nAfter meals         食後            Shokugo         Literally “after eating.”\r\nAt bedtime          就寝前           Shūshin mae     Literally “before sleeping.”\r\n                                                  Used in patient education; pharmacists may\r\nSide effect         副作用           Fukusayō\r\n                                                  explain examples.\r\nExpiration date     使用期限          Shiyō kigen     Legally required on packaging in Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                                    4\r\n\fPharmacy note (2004 context):\r\nIn Japan, prescription durations are typically shorter, especially for antibiotics, and “refill”\r\nsystems differ from the U.S. Therefore, translating “Refill: 2” into Japanese may require\r\nexplanation, since the concept is not always familiar to Japanese patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.2 Common Symptoms and Conditions\r\n\r\n     English      Japanese Romanization                          Usage Notes\r\n                                              Usually means “high temperature”; specify degree if\r\nFever             熱          Netsu\r\n                                              relevant.\r\nHeadache          頭痛         Zutsū            Medical term; patients may say “atama ga itai.”\r\nCough             咳          Seki             Straightforward translation; severity can be added.\r\nCold              風邪         Kaze             General term for common cold; not influenza.\r\nHypertension      高血圧        Kōketsuatsu      Standard medical term.\r\n                                              Standard term; patient education needed for type\r\nDiabetes          糖尿病        Tōnyōbyō\r\n                                              differentiation.\r\nRash              発疹         Hasshin          Also called “shisshin” (湿疹) for eczema-like rash.\r\nDizziness         めまい        Memai            Symptom description; not necessarily vertigo.\r\nShortness of                                  Literally “breath-cut”; may also use 呼吸困難\r\n                  息切れ        Ikigire\r\nbreath                                        (kokyū konnan) in medical context.\r\n\r\nCultural note:\r\nJapanese patients may describe symptoms in milder or more indirect ways out of politeness. For\r\nexample, “a little tired” could mask significant fatigue. Pharmacists should gently probe for\r\nspecifics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.3 Body Parts and Anatomical Terms\r\n\r\nKnowing the correct anatomical terminology ensures clarity in medication directions (e.g.,\r\n“apply to the affected area”) and counseling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                                    5\r\n\fEnglish Japanese                         Romanization\r\nEye     目        Me\r\nEar         耳        Mimi\r\nNose        鼻        Hana\r\nMouth       口        Kuchi\r\nThroat      喉        Nodo\r\nArm         腕        Ude\r\nLeg         脚/足      Ashi (脚 for leg structure, 足 for foot/leg general)\r\nSkin        皮膚       Hifu\r\nStomach 胃 / 腹        I / Hara\r\nHeart       心臓       Shinzō\r\n\r\nPharmacy application:\r\nFor topical medications, specifying the exact anatomical area in Japanese helps prevent misuse\r\n(e.g., “apply inside the ear” vs. “apply to ear area”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.4 Medical Procedures and Diagnostic Terms\r\n\r\n English    Japanese Romanization\r\nBlood test 血液検査 Ketsueki kensa\r\nUrine test      尿検査          Nyō kensa\r\nX-ray           レントゲン Rentogen\r\nMRI             MRI検査        MRI kensa\r\nSurgery         手術           Shujutsu\r\nInjection       注射           Chūsha\r\nVaccination 予防接種             Yobō sesshu\r\nCheck-up        健康診断         Kenkō shindan\r\n\r\nBy internalizing this vocabulary, pharmacy students can move beyond phrasebook dependency\r\nand adapt to real-life patient interactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Translating Prescription Information\r\nPrescription label translation is one of the most safety-critical tasks in pharmacy practice. Errors\r\nhere can directly lead to overdose, underdose, or improper administration.\r\n\r\n                                                                                                       6\r\n\f4.1 Structure of English Prescription Labels\r\n\r\nA standard U.S. label in 2004 includes:\r\n\r\n   •   Patient name\r\n   •   Drug name (brand and/or generic)\r\n   •   Dosage strength\r\n   •   Instructions (Sig)\r\n   •   Quantity\r\n   •   Refills\r\n   •   Prescriber name\r\n   •   Pharmacy contact info\r\n   •   Auxiliary labels (warnings, storage, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2 Structure of Japanese Prescription Labels\r\n\r\nJapanese prescription labels (処方箋ラベル) often:\r\n\r\n   •   Place dosage frequency and timing more prominently.\r\n   •   Include kana reading aids for difficult kanji drug names.\r\n   •   Use metric units exclusively (mg, mL).\r\n   •   Provide fewer auxiliary stickers compared to U.S. practice, relying on verbal pharmacist\r\n       explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.3 Units, Numbers, and Date Formats\r\n\r\nUnit differences:\r\n\r\n   •   Japanese labels never use “tsp” or “tbsp”; all volumes are in mL.\r\n   •   Dates follow YYYY年MM月DD日 format.\r\n\r\nNumber reading tips:\r\n\r\n   •   Dosage “2” is read as ni, but pharmacists may clarify “二錠” (ni-jō, two tablets).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                                  7\r\n\f4.4 Abbreviations and Their Translation Challenges\r\n\r\nEnglish abbreviations like BID, TID, PRN have no direct Japanese equivalent and must be\r\nexpanded:\r\n\r\n   •   BID → 1日2回 (ichinichi nikai) = “twice daily.”\r\n   •   PRN → 必要に応じて (hitsuyō ni ōjite) = “as needed.”\r\n\r\nSafety tip:\r\nAvoid assuming patients know U.S.-style shorthand. Always write instructions in full Japanese\r\nwhen translating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Common Translation Pitfalls\r\nEven pharmacy students with a solid grasp of vocabulary and grammar may encounter subtle,\r\nhigh-risk translation errors. These often stem from over-reliance on literal word-for-word\r\ntranslation, incomplete cultural understanding, or differences in medical conventions between\r\nEnglish- and Japanese-speaking contexts.\r\n\r\nBelow are the most frequent and clinically important pitfalls, along with explanations, examples,\r\nand recommended solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.1 Literal Translation Errors\r\n\r\nLiteral translation—converting each word into its direct equivalent—can distort the intended\r\nmedical meaning.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n   •   English: “Take one tablet every other day.”\r\n   •   Incorrect Japanese literal: 「隔日ごとに1錠服用してください」(Kakujitsu goto ni\r\n       ichijō fukuyō shite kudasai)\r\n   •   Problem: “隔日ごと” is unnatural, confusing, and could be misread as “daily.”\r\n   •   Correct: 「1日おきに1錠服用してください」(Ichinichi oki ni ichijō fukuyō shite\r\n       kudasai)\r\n\r\nPharmacy guidance:\r\nAlways choose the expression most likely to be understood by patients, not the one that is closest\r\nlinguistically to English.\r\n                                                                                                8\r\n\f5.2 Misinterpretation of Dosage Frequency\r\n\r\nDifferences in standard prescription formats can cause dangerous misunderstandings.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n   •     English: “Take two tablets twice daily.”\r\n   •     Possible misinterpretation: A Japanese patient unfamiliar with “twice daily” may read it\r\n         as “two tablets total per day.”\r\n\r\nCorrect translation:\r\n「1日に2回、1回につき2錠服用してください」\r\n(Ichinichi ni nikai, ikkai ni tsuki nijō fukuyō shite kudasai)\r\n\r\nTip for pharmacy students:\r\nBreak dosage instructions into two parts—number of times per day, and number per dose—to\r\navoid ambiguity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.3 Confusion Between Similar Terms (False Friends)\r\n\r\nCertain English medical words have Japanese “false friends” that look or sound similar but have\r\ndifferent meanings.\r\n\r\n                Misleading\r\n English                                                           Correct Japanese for English\r\n                 Japanese         Actual Meaning in Japanese\r\n  Term                                                                        Term\r\n                Equivalent\r\n                                 In Japan, often refers to toner   外用薬ローション (Gaiyōyaku\r\n            ローション\r\nLotion                           or cosmetic liquid, not           rōshon) or 軟膏系液体 (Nankō-\r\n            (Rōshon)             medicinal lotion                  kei ekitai)\r\n                                                                   血清 (Kessei) for biological\r\nSerum       セラム (Seramu)         Often beauty serum\r\n                                                                   serum\r\n            タブレット                May be understood as\r\nTablet                                                           錠剤 (Jōzai)\r\n            (Taburetto)          electronic tablet or supplement\r\n\r\n\r\n5.4 Cultural Differences in Describing Symptoms\r\n\r\nJapanese patients may:\r\n\r\n   •     Use metaphors (“like a heavy rock in my chest”) instead of direct symptom names.\r\n\r\n                                                                                                    9\r\n\f   •   Avoid stating pain severity unless asked directly.\r\n   •   Use “okagesama de” (“thanks to you, I’m fine”) even when still symptomatic.\r\n\r\nPharmacist strategy:\r\nUse open-ended questions, then follow up with clarifying, closed-ended questions to extract\r\nnecessary clinical detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Cultural Competence in Pharmacy Practice\r\nLanguage skills alone are insufficient without cultural competence. Pharmacy students should\r\nunderstand how Japanese cultural norms influence patient expectations, adherence behaviors,\r\nand interpretations of medical advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.1 Japanese Health Beliefs and Patient Expectations\r\n\r\nMany Japanese patients:\r\n\r\n   •   Place high trust in pharmacists but expect clear explanations.\r\n   •   May view Western medicine as powerful but potentially harsh; some prefer lower doses\r\n       or gradual titration.\r\n   •   Often believe in balancing body “constitution” (taishitsu) rather than treating only\r\n       symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.2 Communication Styles: Direct vs. Indirect\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking pharmacists often use direct, explicit instructions. Japanese communication\r\ntends to be:\r\n\r\n   •   High-context: Meaning is implied rather than stated outright.\r\n   •   Politeness-oriented: Direct negative statements (“You are wrong”) are avoided; instead,\r\n       softer phrasing is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.3 Politeness Levels and Honorifics in Medical Settings\r\n\r\nPharmacists addressing patients should use the -san suffix after names and polite verb endings (-\r\nmasu/-desu). However:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                               10\r\n\f   •   Overuse of highly formal keigo (honorific language) can sound distant in a healthcare\r\n       context.\r\n   •   Politeness must be balanced with clarity; overly elaborate phrasing can obscure dosage\r\n       instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Case Studies in Translation and Interpretation\r\n7.1 Dosage Misinterpretation Leading to Overdose\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\nEnglish prescription: “Take 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed for pain (maximum 4 tablets per\r\nday).”\r\nTranslated poorly: Patient understood “every 6 hours” as “6 tablets per day,” leading to 50%\r\noverdose.\r\n\r\nPrevention:\r\nAlways include both time interval and maximum daily limit in Japanese:\r\n「痛みがあるときは6時間ごとに1錠、1日最大4錠まで服用してください。」\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.2 Misunderstood Symptom Description Resulting in Delayed Care\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\nA Japanese tourist described chest pain as 「胸がつまる感じ」 (“a clogged feeling in the\r\nchest”). The pharmacist assumed mild indigestion; later, the patient was diagnosed with angina.\r\n\r\nLesson:\r\nMetaphorical symptom descriptions may indicate serious conditions; pharmacists must probe for\r\nonset, duration, severity, and associated symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.3 Successful Patient Education Through Bilingual Labels\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\nA bilingual auxiliary label (“Shake well before use” / 「よく振ってから使用してください」)\r\nimproved adherence to an antibiotic suspension among Japanese-speaking patients in Hawaii.\r\n\r\nLesson:\r\nSmall bilingual aids can yield measurable improvements in safety and compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                                11\r\n\f8. Ethical and Legal Considerations\r\n8.1 U.S. Pharmacy Law and Language Assistance Requirements\r\n\r\nBy 2004, U.S. federal law (Title VI, Civil Rights Act) and state-level pharmacy boards required\r\n“meaningful access” to services for limited-English-proficiency patients. Providing Japanese\r\ntranslations is part of meeting this requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.2 Japanese Pharmaceutical Regulations and Labeling Laws\r\n\r\nIn Japan:\r\n\r\n   •   Package inserts must be in Japanese.\r\n   •   Certain English terms may be allowed if accompanied by Japanese equivalents.\r\n   •   Dosage instructions are always metric.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.3 Confidentiality and Professional Responsibility\r\n\r\nWhen using interpreters, pharmacists must ensure patient confidentiality and avoid casual\r\ndiscussion of patient details outside the counseling context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Tools and Resources for Translation (2004)\r\n9.1 Dictionaries and Glossaries\r\n\r\n   •   Kenkyusha’s New Japanese-English Dictionary (medical edition)\r\n   •   Stedman’s Medical Dictionary with Japanese supplement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.2 Phrasebooks for Medical Professionals\r\n\r\n2004-era medical phrasebooks were invaluable for on-the-spot translations, though often limited\r\nin clinical specificity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                              12\r\n\f9.3 Computer-Assisted Translation Tools\r\n\r\n   •   CD-ROM-based bilingual medical dictionaries.\r\n   •   Early versions of Eijiro/ALC online dictionary (limited in 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.4 Training Programs and Continuing Education\r\n\r\nSome U.S. pharmacy schools in 2004 began offering electives in “Medical Spanish” — a model\r\nthat could be adapted for Japanese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Best Practices for Pharmacy Students\r\n10.1 Developing Bilingual Patient Information Sheets\r\n\r\nProvide:\r\n\r\n   •   Drug purpose in plain Japanese.\r\n   •   Simple diagrams for usage.\r\n   •   Culturally relevant explanations for side effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.2 Partnering with Professional Medical Interpreters\r\n\r\nEven fluent bilingual pharmacists should confirm critical instructions with a trained interpreter\r\nfor high-risk medications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.3 Role-Playing and Simulation\r\n\r\nSimulated counseling with Japanese-speaking standardized patients helps students practice\r\nlanguage under realistic pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                                    13\r\n\f10.4 Integrating into Experiential Education\r\n\r\nStudents on rotations in areas with Japanese-speaking populations should proactively request\r\nexposure to bilingual counseling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Conclusion and Future Directions\r\nBy mastering essential vocabulary, avoiding literal-translation pitfalls, and embracing cultural\r\ncompetence, pharmacy students can deliver safe, patient-centered care to Japanese speakers. As\r\ntechnology advances beyond 2004, computer-assisted tools will improve—but the pharmacist’s\r\nhuman judgment in translation and counseling will remain irreplaceable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.

If so, avoid driving.”)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix D – 2004 Resource Directory for English–\r\nJapanese Medical Translation in Pharmacy\r\nIn 2004, online tools were far less advanced than today. Pharmacy students relied on printed\r\nreferences, CD-ROM dictionaries, early web resources, and human networks to ensure\r\naccurate English–Japanese translation of medical and prescription information.
